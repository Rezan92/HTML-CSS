1-How do I create a hidden file or folder? How do I display it in the CLI?

   -To create a hidden file or folder we should add(.) at the beginning of the file or folder name
    by using the "mkdir" command.        > mkdir .fileName (or .folderName)
   -To show hidden files and folders we use "ls -a" command. > ls -a
    if you want to show hidden files and folder in a detailed list format use "ls -al" command. > ls -al

2-How do I create multiple nested directories, like /c/Users/myusername/these/folders/are/just/for/fun?
  -To create multiple nested directories we use "mkdir" command and add "-p" option to it. 
  "-p" stand for parents or path, will create the directory(along with the directories that lead to the
  directory you want to create) and would ignore any errors if the directory already exists
    > mkdir -p dir1/dir2/dir3/dir4 .

3-How do I append a message to a file, without a newline character?
  We can append a message to a file by using the "echo" command.
    > echo "first message" >> file.txt
    > echo "second message" >> file.txt
  Also I thing we can use the "cat" command to do the same thing.
    > cat >> file.txt "we click enter and we will be able to add text to the file"
